# PRISM models
This repository contains the code of the PRISM models I have developed for the following papers. <br />
The first paper is about constructing probabilistic performance models for horizontal auto-scalers on Amazon EC2. <br />
The second paper is about constructing probabilistic performance models for horizontal auto-scalers on Amazon EC2 and on Microsoft Azure. It is an extended version of the first one.
